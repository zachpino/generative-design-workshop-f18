# Briefs

Please individually select one of the three briefs below to spend the remaining 7 weeks of the semester on. All projects will progress through ideas and sketches, component sourcing, pseudo-code and behavior mapping, 3d enclosure modeling, wiring and fabrication, and debugging and coding. 

Everyone should take advantage of Zach's time! Send Zach questions by the Friday before class and he promises to have as close to an answer as possible by the following Tuesday's class. Office hours, as always, are Mondays 12-2 (just DigiDev) or Thursdays 9-12 (all classes). Other times are always possible too with an email request!

Regardless of chosen brief, final projects will be evaluated on the following parameters. As always, the main goal of any graduate course is to experiment at the frontiers of the domain, and not to beautifully polish an uninspiring outcome. Also, automatic bonus points for any project that implements a custom PCB.

- 25% Ambition and Novelty 
	- Projects that intentionally push beyond the scope of covered course materials will be scored favorably.
	- Projects that replicate projects from covered course materials or tutorials will be scored poorly.

- 20% Regular Development and Participation
	- Projects that demonstrate significant and consistent week-to-week improvement will be scored favorably.
	- Projects that stall, and show up magically completed for final review, will be scored poorly.

- 20% Collateral Deliverables
	- Projects that show dedication and attention to detail in all submitted materials will be scored favorably.
	- Projects that are accompanied by hastily assembled or incomplete collaterals will be scored poorly.

- 35% Final Design, Aesthetics and Ergonomics, and Contextual Appropriateness
	- Projects that are formally well-matched to their problem domain and intended audience, and demonstrate aesthetic refinement, will be scored favorably.
	- Projects that are unconsidered in their aesthetics, or mismatched to their audience and environment, will be scored poorly.


Check-in deliverables and presentations will be introduced as needed to maintain regular progress. **Work is due for presentation on December 4, and all additional materials need to be submitted by December 10.**

Have fun with these! All can be pushed in a more speculative direction once proof of concept is reached with contemporary components.

## Wearable Behavior Change

Innate human behavior is often mismatched to contemporary social, environmental, economic, and realities. Technology has long intermediated the *natural* human and the *socialized* human, and allowed humans the means to both identify, comprehend, empathize, and interrelate with their peers and context. Technologies have done this socializing task through both *limiting* and *extending* the behaviors of humans — giving us new abilties and constricting our natural impulses. Wearable technologies offer new and far more intimate and intereventional opportunities to both *limit* and *extend* human behaviors, and when coupled with data-driven adaptive algorithms, designers of wearable technologies are more able than ever to sculpt future cultures and interactions.

Contemporary designers are challenged by a set of global and inter-nested problems, and human behavior change is often an essential first step towards any meaningful solution. Could a wearable device identify incoming sexual harassment and empower intervention? No one would deny that a wearable device could obstruct the behaviors that lead to preventable medical conditions such as type 2 diabetes, but could (and should?) a wearable device also prevent behaviors that lead to crimes or civic disillusionment? Could a wearable device support stronger friendships and more inclusive human interactions? 

Choose a set of behaviors embedded in one of the following spaces and design a sensor-driven, wearable device to change how an audience understands their impact and agency in a contemporary problem space through sensor-driven data-collection, light/motion/sound actuation, and algorithmic modeling.

- Human Relationships
- Civic Engagment and Enfranchisement
- Environmental Sustainability
- Wellness and Mindfulness
- Consumption vs. Production

#### Considerations
	- How does the device communicate the wearer of their behaviors and tendencies? Does it confront or nudge?
	- How does the device disguise itself as fashion, or announce itself as technology?
	- How do we keep costs down and ease manufacturing?
	- How might devices communicate with one another and submit their data to the cloud?

#### Deliverables 
	- Final prototype, either as complete work or as a combination *looks alike* fabricated model and *works alike* breadboard model
	- Video documentation of the above
	- Fritzing diagram of all components
	- Tutorial on how to connect all the components, as well as documentation for your code
	- Pictorial representation of how the single wearable might be used, as wells as expanded to a branded family of wearable and/or non-wearable products
	- Photographic documentation PDF of project development

## Wearable Devices for Citizen Scientists
 
The [citizen scientist movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_science) strives to extend the responsibility for scientific advancement beyond academia into the hands of audiences of all ages and skills, everywhere — in order to demystify scientific learning, expand scientific and engineering opportunities to a more inclusive audience, and share the processes and rigor of scientific research with the global community. Embedded and wearable devices are key to this movement, as they both remove some of the skills required, and allow sensors and actuators to travel anywhere a participant can. The *Big Data* that always comes out of such projects has been immensely useful to many scientific initiatives, and contemporary mesh networking and new smaller and cheaper sensors allow data collection projects to explore formerly inaccessible domains. 

[Find](https://www.grants.gov) or invent your own citizen science data-collection project that would benefit from a data-collection wearable. The technologically-enabled object should semi-permanently interface with the audience, or at least be portable — though it doesn't need to collect data from the body. Wearable devices are both intimate and persistent in a way that traditional technologies are not, which offers very specific opportunities for data collection regimens such as [counting and locating the migratory paths of endangered birds](https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=308764), [measuring ambient environmental pollution and weather conditions](https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=309267), or [monitoring the correlation between stress and sleep in a broad population](https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=301180). Strive to find an opportunity that benefits from persistence and wearability.

#### Considerations
	- How do we keep citizen scientists incentivized to continue participating? How is the data they're collecting communicated to them?
	- How does the design of the device prevent human error?
	- How do we keep costs down and ease manufacturing?
	- How might devices communicate with one another and submit their data to the cloud?

#### Deliverables 
	- Final prototype, either as complete work or as a combination *looks alike* fabricated model and *works alike* breadboard model
	- Video documentation of the above
	- Fritzing diagram of all components
	- Tutorial on how to connect all the components, as well as documentation for your code
	- Pictorial representation of the goals of the scientific project, and specifically how the device contributes to it
	- Photographic documentation PDF of project development

## Buggy Space

Embedded microcontrollers allow technologists to not only understand their users better, but also their users' built and natural environments. Choose a compelling and available *physical* space (indoor or outdoor), and design a *set of devices* that would collect data to better understand the complexities of how humans use that space. Topics of interest might include...

- Team Collaboration and Social Interaction
- Healthfulness
- Pathfinding and Navigation
- Space and Resource Availability and Usage 

After choosing a topic area and some technological interventions, imagine how the data derived from the sensors might be synthesized into recommendations for space managers or interior, exterior, or landscape architects.

#### Considerations
	- How do the data collection objects blend into, or stand out from, their space?
	- How do the devices allow for passive and active data-collection?
	- How does the data that comes out of a data-collection regimen get synthesized into more complex learnings?
	- How does having a collection of unique or identical devices throughout a space allow for unique opportunities?

#### Deliverables 
	- Final prototype, either as complete work or as a combination *looks alike* fabricated model and *works alike* breadboard model
	- Video documentation of the above
	- Fritzing diagram of all components
	- Tutorial on how to connect all the components, as well as documentation for your code
	- Pictorial representation of the space and the deployed devices, examples of collected data, and the recommendations that the system would make
	- Photographic documentation PDF of project development
