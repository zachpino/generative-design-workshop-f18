# Briefs

Please read through the provocation and brief below, which we will spend the remaining 7 weeks of the semester on. All projects will progress through ideas and sketches, iterative making and writing, rig development/pseudo-code, physical prototyping, and some parametric modeling program. All projects will be different, and will require different tools and stages to produce.  

Everyone should take advantage of Zach's time! Send Zach questions by the Friday before class and he promises to have as close to an answer as possible by the following Wednesday's class. Office hours, as always, are Mondays 2-5 (just GenDes) or Thursdays 9-12 (all classes). Other times are always possible too with an email request!

Regardless of chosen brief, final projects will be evaluated on the following parameters. Remember that the main goal of any graduate course is to experiment at the frontiers of the domain, and not to beautifully polish an uninspiring outcome. 

- 30% Ambition and Novelty 
	- Projects that intentionally push beyond the scope of covered course materials will be scored favorably.
	- Projects that replicate projects from covered course materials or tutorials will be scored poorly.

- 30% Regular Development and Participation
	- Projects that demonstrate significant and consistent week-to-week improvement will be scored favorably.
	- Projects that stall, and show up magically completed for final review, will be scored poorly.

- 20% Collateral Deliverables
	- Projects that show dedication and attention to detail in all submitted materials will be scored favorably.
	- Projects that are accompanied by hastily assembled or incomplete collaterals will be scored poorly.

- 20% Final Design, Aesthetics and Ergonomics, and Contextual Appropriateness
	- Projects that are formally well-matched to their problem domain and intended audience, and demonstrate aesthetic refinement, will be scored favorably.
	- Projects that are unconsidered in their aesthetics, or mismatched to their audience and environment, will be scored poorly.


Check-in deliverables and presentations will be introduced as needed to maintain regular progress. **Work is due for presentation on December 5, and all additional materials need to be submitted by December 10.**

Have fun with these! All can be pushed in a more speculative direction once proof of concept is reached.

## Provocation

The [Bauhaus is outdated](https://www.goines.net/Writing/bauhaus_isn%27t_our_house.html). [Modernism is the worst](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-modernism-is-the-worst-thing-that-ever-happened-to-architecture-2013-7). [User-Centered Design is a fraud that led to global warming](https://medium.com/@eilishmcvey/a-critique-of-user-centered-design-have-ucd-practices-hindered-an-ecologically-sustainable-future-da0c2b1c2ef8).

[Italian architectural theorist Federica Buzzi](https://federica-buzzi.divisare.pro) wrote a [scathing review of modernist anthropometry](https://failedarchitecture.com/human-all-too-human-a-critique-on-the-modulor/) which is still rocking the architectural world, and serves as a provocative challenge to the user-centrism practiced by contemporary designers of all types. The Cooper Hewitt museum similarly challenged Henry Dreyfuss' seminal text by putting together the [Beautiful Users](https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/exhibitions/51669015/) exhibitition, which strove to introduce a new definition of user-centrism and followed it up with [Access+Accessibility](https://www.cooperhewitt.org/2017/11/27/cooper-hewitt-presents-accessability-featuring-more-than-70-inclusive-designs/). Even [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2018/09/design-thinking-is-fundamentally-conservative-and-preserves-the-status-quo) is jumping in on the action of attacking Modernist design methodologies. 

Browse these resources, and especially consider them as a correlate to Tim Parsons *Thinking Objects* section on designing for inclusion while thinking about the brief below.

## Generative Service

Contemporary digital fabrication and generative tools allow designers to fundamentally rethink the relationship between themselves, their fabrication and logistics, their designs, and their audiences. And, many of those benefits can be immediately leveraged within an era of increasing cultural comfort with individualism, inclusivity, and variable self-definition. Designers have long designed for *audiences*, *markets*, and *personas*, but these newly emergent technologies permit the design discipline to instead produce *bespoke*, *hyper-customized*, and *contextually-targeted* design outcomes.

With these thoughts in your mind, choose a specific designed object (which is an intentionally loose term!). Through the next 7 weeks, consider how that object would be approached from a variety of generative design approaches. Imagine how generative models could enable a diversity of audiences, functionalities, and applications. More importantly, consider how your designed object could be made unique in different ways for different contexts and users.

Regarding the choice of object â€” really anything is possible, but it may be worth considering what kind of work you want to explore this semester.

	- Is your user a human or animal? If so, you'll likely be playing with parametric rigs, data-forms, and thinking about new models for anthropometry.

	- Is your user a space? If so, you'll likely be leveraging generative logics and algorithmic forms from sensor-derived data.

	- Is your user a company, city, or country? If so, you'll likely be using big datasets and generative and evolutionary approaches.

Inherently, this project will require some form of data collection, whether that be direct measuring, pulling down information from APIs, creating a dataset from sensors, or accessing giant public datasources. Consider how you *as a service* might engage your user over time through data collection routines, product scoping and design, and fabrication.

#### Deliverables 
	- Final prototype, either as complete work or as a combination *looks alike* fabricated model and *works alike* breadboard model
	- Service storyboard / 
	- Pseudo-website for product.
	- Photographic documentation PDF of project development
