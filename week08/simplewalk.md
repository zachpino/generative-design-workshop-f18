### Simple Walker in Python

[Agent-Based Modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model) is in many ways the opposite of the evolutionary form finding and simulated formal development discussed previously. 

Rather than the designer thinking about an idealized *final outcome* to minimize or maximize, an agent-based modeling approach allows the designers to specifically define the parameters and abilities of an agent â€” and then observe how that agent exists autonomously given what it can do. An individual is defined, and then *outcomes emerge*. Designing in this way is often termed *Generative Design* because the design, in many meaningful ways, *generates* itself -- though through shaping behaviors the designer can influence the results.

In this simple example, an agent starts at `(0,0,0)` and then, for each time step, is allowed to move a random amount in each of the three dimensions. As time passes, a line connects all of the different positions of the walker, showing the path that it traversed.

This script can be placed inside of a `Python` node in Grasshopper, with inputs for `seed` and `time` hinted to `integer`.

```python
