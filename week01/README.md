### Exercise

Work in small groups to complete a parametric *rig* of a t-shirt, as defined during our class discussion. 

What datapoints might be critical to define the *custom fit* of a garment or object? What would allow that object to be *uniquely* targeted to specific users? 

How might we begin to parameterize *preference*, not just *fit*? How broad an audience could be served by the rig you have defined? What are the *natural extents* of the rig that you've defined?
