# Week 5 · Data Forms

We'll examine this week how contemporary designers are using data — both at an individual and global level — to create uniquely meaningful 3d forms with functional, aesthetic, and public awareness goals.

This particular emerging topic — the creation of a different type of *smart-object* — sits at the nexus of data science and visualization, generative design practice, and communication design.

### Tactile Data

![form follows data by iohanna pani](https://www.designboom.com/cms/images/-Z84/ff1.jpg)

Data forms, a new term for an even newer aesthetic archetype, is a very young discipline. As data visualization has become more common in 2D and interactive applications — 3-dimensional artists, architects, and designers have begun to experiment with physicalized 3D data — and have questioned how we can effectively communicate more complex information through 3D form. 

Embedding data in physical 3D rather than 2D form allows for many obvious benefits. Materiality, surface finish, color, scale, texture, volume, enclosedness, placement in the world, weight... these all become meaningful choices in 3D form, and provide additional vectors for data-driven intentionality.  More intrigueing, perhaps, these same designers have experimented with creating data forms that replace traditional objects — provoking users to engage them as everyday in everyday confrontations — constant and unavoidable reminders of the embedded data with the goal of both awareness and behavior change. 

Would you eat differently if your tableware reminded you of the world's obesity epidemic? Would you use your computer differently if its palmrest was shaped with data of your region's energy usage? Would you spend your days differently if your couch was cushioned with the data of the time you and your friend group spend on Facebook and Netflix?

### Grasshopper Definition

Let's manipulate outside data in Grasshopper 


#### Data Plotting

Different ways to plot 3d points based on information (here random numbers) and convert those points into a variety of 3d forms.

### Homework

We will be discussing anthropometry next week!

- Read: Download this PDF copy of the original [Measure of Man](MeasureOfMan.pdf) by Henry Dreyfuss (released in 1959) and the revised version [Measure of Man and Woman](MeasureOfManAndWoman.pdf) edited by Alvin Tilley (released in 1993) and Henry Dreyfuss Associates (the company Henry Dreyfuss founded). Please also read about [Henry Dreyfuss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Dreyfuss), the original author and one of the first *data-driven designers*.

	Browse through the whole books (they're mostly pictures) to get a sense of the contents, and please read pages 7-11, 33, 35, and 36 of *Measure of Man and Woman*. Please prepare to discuss the *motivation* of these texts, and how we should confront them as *inclusive* designers. Are texts like this useful to our design practice? How might different disciplines, like the many social sciences, evaluate our reliance on books like this?
